# Chatbot (Customer Support)

## Priority: Low  
Quality of life feature for user support

## Estimation: 1 day  
Planning Poker:  
* Sungha: 1 day  
* Mi-La: 1 day  
* Yuyang: 1 day  

## Assumptions (if any):  
- Tidio chatbot is integrated via script into all public-facing pages (e.g., `index.html`, `booking.html`, `faq.html`)  
- No login required to access chatbot  
- AI chatbot can handle common FAQs and direct users to human support when needed  

## Description:  
Description-v1: As a user, I want to get quick answers to my questions through a live chat interface, so I can resolve issues without making phone calls or waiting for emails.

Description-v2: As a user, I want to get real-time support through a chatbot integrated into the website. The chatbot should answer frequently asked questions, assist with booking or payment issues, and escalate to a human agent if needed. The system should be always available, provide friendly and helpful responses, and offer suggested replies or links when appropriate. This improves the customer experience by providing accessible and fast support directly within the web app.

## Tasks  

1. Select and configure chatbot platform (Tidio): 0.3 days  
2. Embed chatbot script into main HTML templates (e.g., `index.html`, `faq.html`): 0.3 days  
3. Set up FAQ flows, welcome message, and escalation options: 0.4 days
