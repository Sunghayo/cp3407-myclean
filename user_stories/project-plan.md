## Iteration 1 Retrospective

### What went well
- Completed all planned core features (Login, Booking, Payment) within the iteration.
- GitHub repository and project board organization improved collaboration and progress tracking.
- Smooth backend–frontend integration with minimal conflicts.
- Firestore database setup was stable, meeting scalability and security requirements.

### What could be improved
- Initial task estimates were optimistic; some tasks required more time than expected.
- Burn down chart updates were less frequent than planned, reducing visibility for progress tracking.
- Limited early testing resulted in a few minor bugs being discovered later.
- Delays in finalizing UI/UX design mockups caused a late start for some frontend tasks.
- Uneven workload distribution among team members slowed down certain tasks.

### Action items for next iteration
- Update chart at least twice weekly for better progress monitoring.
- Conduct earlier and more frequent testing to catch issues sooner.
- Finalize UI/UX designs before development begins to avoid delays.
- Ensure more balanced workload allocation across team members.
