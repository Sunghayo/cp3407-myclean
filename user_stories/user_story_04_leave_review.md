# Leave Review

## Priority: Medium
Helps future customers make decisions

## Estimation: 1 day
Planning Poker: 
* Sungha: 1 day
* Mi-La: 1 day
* Yuyang: 1 day

## Assumptions (if any):
- Users will only be allowed to leave reviews for completed bookings
- Cleaners will not be able to reply or edit reviews
- The system will display average ratings and recent reviews on the cleanerâ€™s profile

## Description: 
Description-v1: As a customer, I want to leave a star rating and review after a service so that I can provide feedback and help others.

Description-v2: As a user, I want to leave reviews and ratings for cleaners after a completed service so that others can make informed decisions. The system should support a simple and intuitive review interface where users can provide a star rating (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) and an optional written comment. Only users with verified and completed bookings should be able to submit reviews to ensure credibility.
