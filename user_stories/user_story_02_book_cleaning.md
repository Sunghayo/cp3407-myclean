## Description:  
**Description-v1**: As a customer, I want to book a cleaning session by selecting the service type, date, and time, so that my home can be cleaned when itâ€™s most convenient for me. The system should confirm the booking and store it in the database.  

**Description-v2**: Customers should be able to choose a cleaning type (standard, deep clean, etc.), specify location and preferred schedule, and get immediate feedback on booking success or availability issues.

## Tasks  
1. Design booking form with service/date/time selection: 0.5 day  
2. Implement booking logic and validation: 1 day  
3. Confirm and store booking in database: 0.5 day

# Completed:

* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
