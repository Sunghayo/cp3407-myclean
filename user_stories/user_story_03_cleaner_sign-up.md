# Cleaner Sign-Up

## Priority: Medium  
Allow cleaners to register and offer their services.

## Estimation: 2 days  
* Sungha: 2 days  
* Mi-La: 2 days  
* Yuyang: 2 days  

## Assumptions  
- Cleaners are individuals looking to provide services through the app.  
- Verification (e.g. admin approval or ID check) will be handled in a later phase.  

## Description:  
**Description-v1**:  
As a cleaner, I want to sign up by submitting my profile, availability, and service preferences, so that I can be listed as an available provider to customers.

**Description-v2**:  
The cleaner registration feature should collect full name, contact details, service types offered, and preferred working hours. Once submitted, the system will confirm registration and add the cleaner to the service provider list. Future enhancements may include background checks or profile verification.

## Tasks  
1. Design sign-up form with fields: name, contact, services, availability â€“ 0.5 day  
2. Develop form validation and submission backend â€“ 1 day  
3. Display confirmation screen after successful registration â€“ 0.5 day
